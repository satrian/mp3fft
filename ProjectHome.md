This piece of software will take a MP3 of WAV file as an input and generate a FFT spectrum plot (aka waterfall) of the whole file.
Works only on Windows family of operating systems.

Originally designed for analyzing large shortwave (radio) monitoring data, it can also handle a very large, gigabyte range audio files. Be sure to give meaningful parameters to the software on that case, since having an output picture file 100Kpixels of horizontal size may be impractical in many cases! :)

Its a command line utility, so it can be easily used  inside batch files. The penalty of course is, that those unfamiliar with command line in windows, have to do a little extra learning step.
